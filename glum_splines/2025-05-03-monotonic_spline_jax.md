Let's say you have a trend you are trying to model that you know to be
monotonically increasing or decreasing; this could be something like
default as a function of risk, power usage as a function of temperature,
or CO2 emissions over time. [Generalized Additive
Models](http://statmills.com/2023-11-20-Penalized_Splines_Using_glum/)
(GAMs) are a great general purpose modeling tool that you could use to
model these relationships, but they are unconstrained and could have
undesired shape behavior. It turns out that there are variations of GAMs
that allow for enforcing a constraint on a spline curve;
Penalized-splines (P-splines) and Shape Constrained Additive Models
(SCAM). This contraint could be an always increasing or decreasing
function, or even a convex or concave shape. P-splines use a penalty
matrix to enfore the constraint by penalizing differences between
neighboring coefficients. SCAMs use a different parameterization of a
GAM that I wanted to learn more about. This blog post is an attempt to
recreate the logic in the [SCAM
paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/271740857_Shape_constrained_additive_models)
using python and JAX. If you want to use these types of models for real
there is an [R-package for
SCAMs](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/scam/index.html) and a
P-spline implementation in python using the [pygam
library](https://pygam.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/api.html#spline-term).

### Shape Constrained What-now?

Shape Constrained Additive Models :) SCAMs use a reparameterization of a
traditional B-spline basis to enforce a constraint. If you want a
refresher on B-Splines and GAMs I wrote an [introductory focused
post](http://statmills.com/2023-11-20-Penalized_Splines_Using_glum/)
last year. Briefly though B-Splines are a basis expansion consisting of
individual basis splines (**B-S**pline) that cover the range of the
data. A GAM is usually expressed as a B-spline with coefficients for
each basis that are learned from the data while estimating some trend.

When we add learned coefficients for each spline we are fitting a model
$\hat{Y} = \mathbf{X}\mathbf{\beta}$:

![](.img/monotonic_spline_jax/cell-4-output-1.png)

With a reparameterization we can model trends with a specific shape, for
example a monotonically increasing function.

![](/img/monotonic_spline_jax/cell-5-output-1.png)

How do we do this reparameterization? A traditional B-spline can be
expressed as

$$
\hat{Y} = \mathbf{X}\mathbf{\beta}
$$

Where $\mathbf{X}$ is the $n$ by $j$ spline-transformed data matrix and
$\mathbf{\beta}$ are the $j$ coefficients found from fitting a model to
the data. If we don't impose any constraints or penalties this could
just be fit as a standard GLM. But now we want to force the curve to
either always go up, or always go down.

This new expression of the B-spline basis has two components: 1. A
transformation on the coefficients of a traditional B-spline to ensure
they are always positive 2. A constraint matrix inserted in the
$\mathbf{X} \mathbf{\beta}$ multiplication.

The first step of the reparameterization is simple enough, we apply the
exponential function to our unconstrained coefficients:

$$
\tilde{\beta} = \exp(\beta)
$$

Now each transformed coefficient is stricly positive. We'll see the
reason for this below.

The constraint matrix combines these transformed coefficients so that
the desired constraint is adhered to. We'll walk through how this works
for a decreasing trend. We know our transformed coefficients are
strictly positive. So if we want our curve to always decrease, then each
successive coefficient we multiply with our $X$ matrix needs to be
strictly smaller than the previous coefficient. We can accomplish this
by applying another reparameterization to our coefficients. Lets set the
first coefficient in our new coefficient vector $\overline{\beta}$ as
our first stricly positive coefficient:

$$
\overline{\beta_1} = \tilde{\beta_1}
$$

The next coefficient now needs to be less than this first value. One way
to do that is to subtract our $\tilde{\beta_2}$ value from
$\tilde{\beta_1}$ and use the result as the 2nd transformed coefficient.
Since we know $\tilde{\beta_2}$ is positive (from using the exponential
function) then we know that $\beta_1$ is strictly larger than
$\tilde{\beta_1} - \tilde{\beta_2}$. We can repeat this logic the whole
way down our vector of coefficients:

{::nomarkdown}
\begin{equation}
\overline{\beta_1} = \tilde{\beta_1} \\
\overline{\beta_2} = \tilde{\beta_1} - \tilde{\beta_2} \\
\overline{\beta_3} = \tilde{\beta_1} - \tilde{\beta_2} - \tilde{\beta_3} \\
\dots
\end{equation}
{:/nomarkdown}

We don't have to write these equations out by hand, we can leverage a
lower triangle matrix where all values are negative 1 except the first
column.

{::nomarkdown}
\mathbf{\overline{\beta}} =
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
1 & -1 & 0 & 0 \\
1 & -1 & -1 & 0 \\
1 & -1 & -1 & -1 \\
\end{bmatrix}
\mathbf{\tilde{\beta}}
{:/nomarkdown}

The SCAM paper doesn't create this 2nd intermediate coefficient vector
$\mathbf{\overline{\beta}}$ but instead just includes the constraint
matrix $\mathbf{Sigma}$ in the prediction matrix multiplication:

$$
\hat{Y} = \mathbf{X} \mathbf{\Sigma} \mathbf{\tilde{\beta}}
$$

To summarize the process we first start with unconstrained coefficients
that we transform into positive numbers. Then we combine them in a way
so that the resulting coefficients on each input column in $\mathbf{X}$
are decreasing as we move along the coefficients. Then we multiply those
values by the basis matrix to generate our predictions.

### Comparison with P-splines

P-splines enforce a monotonic constraint using a penalty matrix instead
of a constraint matrix. This penalty matrix uses the difference matrix
to punish any difference between neighboring coefficients that goes
against this desired trend.

{::nomarkdown}
\begin{bmatrix}
-1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & -1 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & -1 & 1 \\
\end{bmatrix}
{:/nomarkdown}

For decreasing trends only positive values for $\beta_{i+1} - \beta_i$
would contribute a penalty to the loss function, while a negative value
would not contribute anything. If I have time for another post I'll do a
more thorough comparison to see how the differences actually manifest in
model fitting between the two methods.

### An Example: Japanese Cherry Blossom Data

There is a phenomenal dataset of the first day of the Cherry Blossoms
blooming in the Japanese Royal Gardens every year since 812 AD. I want
to estimate the long-term trend of this date moving up over time due to
Global Warming. There are natural, short-term fluctuations in this data
based on the local climate in Japan so an accurate model of the year to
year fluctuations will not be monotonically decreasing. For this post
I'm only interested in the long-term trend which I'm going to assume
only goes one way. We'll read in some data and build our model. I'm only
going to show some code cells and output, but if you want to see the
full code it is available on my github.

### Fitting a Model with JAX

Previously I used the excellent `glum` package to fit a GAM using a
penalty matrix. We can't use that approach for SCAMs though because the
constraint is enforced as we get predictions at the model matrix level,
not as an additional penalty in the loss function. So we need a way to
learn the optimal coefficients directly. I thought this would be a great
chance to use JAX. JAX is a "numpy + autodif" library in python that
many advanced Deep Learning models are built with these days. The reason
we would use JAX to fit our model is that JAX will calculate a
derivative of a function automatically. So all we need to do is write a
loss function that accepts our input parameters, the unconstrained
coefficients, and JAX will automatically calculate 1st and 2nd order
gradients that we can pass to scipy's optimization function `minimize`.
I'll write a helper function to get the predictions and then write
functions to calculate our loss function, gradients, and hessians. I do
want to re-iterate again that our loss function and it's derivatives
operate on the unconstrained parameter values before we exponentiate
them. Then we (well really scipy) apply the necessary transformations at
each run after applying the necessary gradient updates to the raw
paramter values.

``` {.python .cell-code}
def predict_mono_bspline(coefs, X=yearly_spline, direction='dec'):
    """
    Predicts values from a monotonic B-spline model without an intercept.
    coefs: full coefficient vector
    X: basis spline matrix.
    direction: 'inc' for increasing, 'dec' for decreasing.
    """
    coef_b = coefs  # Shape-constrained coefficients
    
    # Apply the shape constraint only to coef_b
    constrained_coefs = apply_shape_constraint(coef_b, direction)
    model_coefs = constrained_coefs
    
    # Compute predictions
    preds = jnp.dot(X, model_coefs)
    return preds


def calc_loss(coefs, X=yearly_spline, y=flower_df_clean['flower_moy'].to_numpy()):
    preds = predict_mono_bspline(coefs, X)
    loss = jnp.mean(jnp.power(y - preds, 2))
    return loss


loss_grad = jax.grad(calc_loss)
loss_hess = jax.hessian(calc_loss)
```

Now we have what we need to fit our model!

``` {.python .cell-code}
coefs = base_model.coef_

gs = loss_grad(coefs)
hs = loss_hess(coefs)

result = minimize(
    fun=calc_loss,
    x0=np.array(coefs),  # SciPy requires NumPy
    jac=loss_grad,  # First derivative
    hess=loss_hess,  # Second derivative (optional, speeds up convergence)
    method="Newton-CG",
    options={"disp": True}
)
```

We can zoom in on the parts of the trend that actually decrease to see
the difference in the relevant time period more clearly.

### Conclussion

The core insight from this post is that we can enforce shape constraints
on our functions using a special parameterization of a traditional
Generalized Additive Model. You can enforce any number of shapes using
slightly different shape matrices. We then used JAX and Scipy to find
optimal coefficients for this type of Shape Constrained Additive Model.
